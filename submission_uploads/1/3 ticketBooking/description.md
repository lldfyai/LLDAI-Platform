### **Problem Description**  
You are required to design and implement a Ticket Booking System for a movie theatre. The system should allow operations such as finding shows based on city and movie, displaying available seats for a show, and booking seats.  
The system consists of multiple classes including (but not limited to):

- **User** â€“ Represents a user of the system.
- **Theatre** â€“ Represents a theatre located in a city.
- **Movie** â€“ Represents a movie.
- **BookingSystem** â€“ Handles the core operations such as finding shows, displaying seats, and booking seats.


## Operations

1. **FIND_SHOWS**:  
   - **Input Format:** `FIND_SHOWS <CityName> [MovieName]`  
   - **Output:** A line containing space-separated show IDs that match the city (and, if given, the movie).

2. **SHOW_SEATS**:  
   - **Input Format:** `SHOW_SEATS <ShowID>`  
   - **Output:** A single line listing each seat in the hall as:  
     `<seatNumber>-<type>-<status>` (where status is either *Empty* or *Booked*), separated by spaces.

3. **BOOK_SEATS**:  
   - **Input Format:** `BOOK_SEATS <UserID> <ShowID> <NumberOfSeats> <SeatNumber1> <SeatNumber2> ...`  
   - **Output:**  
     - If all requested seats are available, book them, generate a ticket, and print:  
       `Ticket <TicketID> Booked for User <UserID> for Show <ShowID>: [<seat1>,<seat2>,...]`  
       followed by a new line with the updated seats status (as in the SHOW_SEATS operation).  
     - If any requested seat is already booked, output:  
       `Already booked`  
       followed by a new line displaying the current seat status.

     - A line with: `<HallID> <TheatreID> <Number of Seats>`  
     - Next line: Space-separated list of seat types for that hall.

4. **Movies:**
